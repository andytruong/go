    comming feature will help you to do routing in Drupal just faster.
  - node_edit_protection — A void user to exit editing node by accident.

    dependencies, no make the full Drupal code base.

  - Better Cache Flushing - It's readlly hard to flush cache on high Drupal traffic
    websites, this feature provide something new…
  - go_content_group() — which solve this issue:
    — Quicktabs module provide API to render contents as tabs. It does not
      support render div/accordion/fieldset/slideshow/…
    - Field Group module can render contents in to groups in div/accordion/
      fieldset/slideshow/… but it is tied to Form, no API for us to render the
      normal content.
