1. Better format similar feature in simple implementation.

  Read sample configure in go.config.sample.php

2. No current password

  Drupal 7 added a new feature: If a user changes their email or password, they
  are required to enter their current password. (see the 5+ year old
  issue: http://drupal.org/node/86711)

  However, the implementation causes problems for certain edge cases. (For
  example, http://drupal.org/node/889772) Or, you may just not like the design
  decision. Either way, this module makes it optional.

  To disable this default bahavior, in settings.php add this line:

    define('GO_NO_CURRENT_PASSWORD', TRUE);
